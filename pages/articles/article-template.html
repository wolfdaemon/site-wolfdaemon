				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
				<p>Dear Reader,</p>
				<p>It may appear strange to you that I would start an blog as a letter.
				I must say with great contention that it is awfully late into the night,
				and that my mind is struggling to translate. I also must admit that is
				has been a long time since I have written a piece that exceeds words
				that are beyond the conventional constraints of a long, heartfelt text
				message. It is with my best hope that things will improve as we go along
				‚Äî or not. You see, I‚Äôm still trying to see how personal I wish to be
				with you.</p>

				<h2 id="of-sharing-information">Of sharing information</h2>

				<p>I guess I will write to you as if you were my son or daughter, or
				maybe a nephew or niece. I usually end up being the one to give advice
				whenever I finally open my mouth, as if I have some profound wisdom.
				That‚Äôs the impression I am told by the various people that I rub
				shoulders with for any sort of extended time. I am curious as to the
				implications that this will have later. All written material is subject
				to change; that‚Äôs what I like about websites, anyway. I hate when
				everything is tracked to a tee.</p>

				<p>Come to think of it, this kinda reminds me of <a
				href="https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140509">The Screwtape
				Letters</a> by <em>Clive Staples Lewis</em>. Although, the difference I
				assume is that I won‚Äôt tell you the secrets as to tempting people how to
				sin, but rather the opposite: how to control the one thing you can
				control: yourself. Seems silly, but I am suprised as to how profound and
				mystical this knowledge appears to the average Joe or Jane in practice.
				If it were any lesson I would teach anyone, it would be this.</p>
			</section>

				<h2 id="upcoming-topics">Upcoming topics</h2>

				<p>This blog will contain information on the following:
					<ol>
						<li>My whereabouts (which will be related to whatever is below)</li>
						<li>Technology</li>
						<li>Philosophy</li>
						<li>Media</li>
						<li>Miscellanous</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>Most of this will be advice. However, just in case I get personal
				again, I wish to inform you that I can‚Äôt promise a strictly
				informational tone. Just how it is.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>I trust this information is helpful.</p>
				<p>Have fun,</p>

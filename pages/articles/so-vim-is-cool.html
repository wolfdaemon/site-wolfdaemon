        <article>
	    <p>There's something about graphical text editors that are extremely redundant. At the metaphysical core of the process of editing text, for whatever purpose that may be, it is just that: editing text. As monsterous of a task as they are culturally hyped to be, the activities of software development, project management, and user support is metaphysically boiled down to the act of utilizing logic and language. This very webpage, like all others, is just that: a document. Upon reaching that realization, I immediately discovered an effective way to alleviate the anxieties I had experienced during my long and challenging journey in learning web development--akin to Samurai Jack’s swift quest to defeat Aku.
	    </p>
	    <p>So here I am, about to undergo a transition from my previous professional position that was less precisely technical into a role that is moreso technical. It's closer to the ideal role that I originally had the vision of obtaining years ago when I started entering the global workforce. One of the things that has been cited as exceptionally useful from both of the departments that I have been in contact with in regards to by primary vocation is the use of my documentative skills. All I have to say about this is: praise to Markdown. 
	    </p>
	    <p>Dear Reader, this is not an article about Markdown necessarily (although, it's <em>very</em> awesome), but I will say that markup languages benefit greatly my contribution in this topic to demonstrate my experience with what supposedly awes the "average" computer user today: the power of leveraging plain text. My observation indicate that most people would say that plain text wouldn't quantify as "awesome", particularly because they're not aware of how much it runs the world. I could gush over the many ways that knowing how to use knowing markup instead of being chained to a Rich Text file that is mostly designed to work with a singluar program, but unless anyone specifically asks for that, I am not sure I'm going to waste my breath on that topic.
	    </p>
	    <p>I guess what my eventual point to the drivel that I put above is necessary to address the topic at scope; the eventual journey that one will come to is a more desirable way to do this very job more efficently: at the end of the day... you're just staring at text. Given that it's suprisingly not the most engaging topic to me, I am going to make the grand assumption that you probably don't either. For the sake of your eye's health (and my wrist's), I have finally explored the solution to the problem that's been memed to death in programming/freedom software social spaces: VIM.
	    </p>
	    <p>I'm not sure if I am have that much more detail to give at this time, becuase given my style of writing, it will turn into another tutorial article. To answer more generally, I like these few facts about VIM:
	    <ul>
		    <li>It is a CLI (command line interface) program (which is all that is necessary for a plain text editor).</li>
		    <li>It has the COMMAND function which allows you to so many things with the files you're editing in such an intuitive, small-footprint interface, without needing to leave VIM, and while utilizing other system tools.</li>
		    <li>It has a system of navigation (keybinds) that is also intuitive, and allows you to stay on the keyboard, which allows me to work with much faster, and doesn't kill my wrists.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>In regards to this draft.. that's really all I have to say. Subject to change.</p>
